== NodeJ Completion of the Node.js API ==

The Node.js API is fairly large, and some of it is really very specific to
the fact that Node.js is built in C and thus dependent on system level 
functionality. The system level addons are an obvious example of this. Since
NodeJ is written in Java and thus freed from the binary shackles of the
Operating System, some of the stuff in Node.js just doesn't make sense
in NodeJ.

This document is an attempt to clarify what bits of the Node.js API are
available in NodeJ and to identify any workarounds as necessary.

In some cases, we've copied the Node.js javascript files as-is. When the Node.js
source is dependent only on Javascript bits, and nothing in the C bindings,
there's no need to rewrite it all. In other cases, where Node.js depends on
C bindings, we've got our own spin on things with the vert.x engine or even
just plain old Java code.

Work on the API implementation is prioritized by the current Node.js Stability
Index.  Features with a stability index of 2 or below are less important in
most cases than the more stable features.

[role=api]
=== Assert ===
http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html

Complete. All functions should behave as expected.  A direct copy of Node.js
source code.

[role=api]
=== Buffer ===
- Node.js reference http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html
- NodeJ status details http://nodej.org/api/buffer

In progress (lanceball).

[role=api]
=== C Addons ===
http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html

Not applicable. Extensions to NodeJ can be written in Java, Javascript, JRuby,
Python or any other language supported by vert.x.

[role=api]
=== Child Processes ===
http://nodejs.org/api/child_processes.html

Not applicable. If we do implement this API, it certainly won't actually be
spawning new processes.

[role=api]
=== Cluster ===
http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html

Clustering is handled for now through vert.x builtin clustering. (Node.js
stability index 1)

[role=api]
=== Crypto ===
http://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html

In progress (abstractj).

[role=api]
=== Debugger ===
http://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html

Work not started.

[role=api]
=== DNS ===
http://nodejs.org/api/dns.html

Work not started.

[role=api]
=== Domain ===
http://nodejs.org/api/domain.html

Incomplete. (Node.js stability index 1)

[role=api]
=== Events ===
http://nodejs.org/api/events.html

Complete. All functions should behave as expected.  A direct copy of Node.js
source code.

[role=api]
=== File System ===
http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html

In progress (sblanc, et al).

[role=api]
=== Globals ===
http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html

Complete. All functions should behave as expected.  

[role=api]
=== HTTP ===

[role=api]
=== HTTPS ===
http://nodejs.org/api/https.html

Work not started.

[role=api]
=== Modules ===
http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html

Complete, except for project-based module loading (https://github.com/projectodd/nodej/issues/4)

[role=api]
=== Net ===
http://nodejs.org/api/net.html

Complete. All functions should behave as expected.  

[role=api]
=== OS ===
http://nodejs.org/api/os.html

Incomplete. Some functions are currently stubbed.

[role=api]
=== Path ===
http://nodejs.org/api/path.html

Complete. All functions should behave as expected.

[role=api]
=== Process ===
http://nodejs.org/api/process.html

Incomplete (lanceball)

[role=api]
=== Punycode ===
http://nodejs.org/api/punycode.html

Complete. All functions should behave as expected.

[role=api]
=== Query Strings ===
http://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html

Complete. All functions should behave as expected.

[role=api]
=== Readline ===
http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html
