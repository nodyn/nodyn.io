# Talk to Us

As much as I love IRC for developer communication, it's easy to miss conversations,
requests, bug reports, etc. And now that we're ready to start talking about Nodyn
a bit more publicly, we really need to fill the communication gap. So, I have created
a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodyn) to fill some of
these holes.

<!-- more -->

Do you have a question about how to use Nodyn? Want to learn more about the internals?
Would you like to ask us why we are doing this? You can do all of that and more now
on the Google Group. So head on over there and chat us up.
